    "The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model capable of estimating the likelihood that a client will subscribe to a bank term deposit following a telemarketing call.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project leverages the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository — a dataset originally used in the study by Moro, Cortez, and Rita (2014), “A Data-Driven Approach to Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing” (Decision Support Systems, 2014).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains detailed information on clients’ demographic, financial, and behavioral attributes, along with macroeconomic indicators.\n",
    "The inclusion of these five additional socio-economic features—such as employment variation rate, consumer confidence, and EURIBOR rate—has been shown to substantially improve predictive performance, making this dataset the preferred choice for this analysis."

During this process, shared identifiers are used to align records across files, while NumPy and pandas utilities support validation checks to ensure consistency, resolve missing or mismatched entries, and confirm structural integrity. The resulting dataset provides a reliable foundation for the subsequent preprocessing, modeling, and analysis stages."
